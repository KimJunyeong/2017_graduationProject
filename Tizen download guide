download tizen sdk at this url.
I don't know why, but writing in korean here is unstable.
I think developer love english, or some developer thinks that all developer love them, or they just trust us..
for example samsung is korean enterprise, but developer site is all written in english.

anyway, download it. and later on tizen studio makes you to choose package manager.
gear fit2 is the latest version of gear fit series, just download 2.3.2 wearable. apparently the manual doesn't care.
when you download 2.3.2 wearable, tizen sdk tool will be downloaded too.
